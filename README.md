These plugin and microservice will help you manage your devices through direct SSH connection.
It allows the configuration of device profiles that are sets of shell scripts based on Thymeleaf templates.
Script runs are queued as operations and manage by the microservice, which therefore allows running scripts in bulk mode.
This is the exact opposite of thin-edge in terms of architecture, but can be quite useful... for installing thin-edge in bulk mode on devices for instance :)
More to come soon...
